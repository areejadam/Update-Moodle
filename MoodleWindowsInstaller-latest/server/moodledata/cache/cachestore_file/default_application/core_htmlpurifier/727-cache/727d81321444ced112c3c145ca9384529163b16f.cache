s:661:"<p>The scheduler activity helps you in scheduling appointments with your students.</p>

<p>Teachers specify time slots for meetings, students then choose one of them on Moodle.
Teachers in turn can record the outcome of the meeting - and optionally a grade - within the scheduler.</p>

<p>Group scheduling is supported; that is, each time slot can accommodate several students, and optionally it is possible to schedule appointments for entire groups at the same time.</p>
