s:721:"<p>You may choose here some variants in the way appointments can be taken. </p>

<p></p><ul>
<li><strong>"n appointments in this scheduler":</strong> The student can only book a fixed number of appointments in this activity. Even if the teacher marks them as "seen", they will not be allowed to book further meetings. The only way to reset ability of a student to book is to delete the old "seen" records.</li>
<li><strong>"n appointments at a time":</strong> The student can book a fixed number of appointments. Once the meeting is over and the teacher has marked the student as "seen", the student can book further appointments. However the student is limited to n "open" (unseen) slots at any given time.
